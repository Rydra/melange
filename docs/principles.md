# Ideas and principles

*TODO: Complete this section with accurate information*

Melange builds upon the concepts of Domain Driven Design.

If want to have a clean event-driven architecture with Domain Events, and its idea has 
been grabbed from Vaughn Vernon and his must-read book 
Implementing Domain-Driven Design (look at [part 3 of these series](http://dddcommunity.org/library/vernon_2011/) if you want a quick look,
 or read this excellent article from [Udi Dahan, founder of NServiceBus](http://udidahan.com/2009/06/14/domain-events-salvation/)).

If you wanna learn more about how to do clean architectures and domain well isolated from
your technology stack I advise, again, to read *Implementing Domain-Driven Design* from Vaughn Vernon
and *Clean Architecture* from Uncle Bob
