# Examples

Here are listed some relevant examples that you can find in the source code of Melange,
alongside some explanation. The `MessagingBackend` used for all the examples is the
`LocalSQSBackend`, though you could use your own.

Personally what I do is to spin up a docker-compose process and then run the examples.
